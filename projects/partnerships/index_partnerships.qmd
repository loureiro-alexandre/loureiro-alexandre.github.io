I maintain active partnerships with researchers at the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus (Nova Scotia, Canada), Acadia University (Nova Scotia, Canada), and at the State University of Minas Gerais (Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais, UEMG), Brazil, where I am involved in agricultural entomology/ecology projects, exploratory ecology, and some theoretical biology work.
