<p>If you are familiar with this macro-ecology area of inquiry, you might have heard that species diversity decreases with elevation either in linear fashion or in a hump-shaped trend. Statements like these lead you to believe that that line of inquiry is solved, and that these patterns must, therefore, be expected everywhere and with every taxa. That may be true to some extent, but that extent is not nearly as extensive as it seems! The papers that lead to statements like those are mostly meta-analyeses or reviews that attempt to summarise what these patterns are, and they tend to use mostly vertebrate data. Can we therefore expect to see these vertebrate patterns in invertebrate communities? The answer is not so clear. Indeed, there are few papers that review or meta-analyse diversity patterns along elevation gradients for invertebrates. And so, I’m on a mission to do just that for the most diverse animal order in the world: the Coleoptera (beetles)!</p>

<p>Often, we find species where they are because of some abiotic variable that dictates where a species can and cannot be. While temperature is a well-known driver of species distributions, it is not always the causal factor. One way to find more evidence of the direct effects of temperature on the distribution of any given species is to measure some physiological traits that are known to respond to those effects, and to then map how they change with the community and connect that information to the environmental temperature changes. In this chapter, I am doing just that for the ant community in a field-forest gradient in Guelph, Ontario! I am measuring workers’ heat and cold tolerance for many species and tracking how those numbers change along the environmental gradient and how well those changes can be explained by changes in temperature!</p>

<p>For my MSc thesis, I studied the ecology of ground beetles (Carabidae) in lowbush blueberry fields. My focus ranged from individual feeding behaviours and movement to genus-level community analyses. Ground beetles are known for being beneficial to lowbush blueberry fields, where they feed on both weed seeds and the larvae of some insect pests. In a 2012 study, researchers found over 50 species of ground beetle that range from herbivores to carnivores within blueberry fields and described some of their community distribution within their fields of study. My chapters expand on some of that work and tackle different questions relating to some of the most abundant carabid species in lowbush blueberry fields!</p>

<p>Though the carabid community had already been mapped to a certain extent in the 2012 study, there was still so much to explore! For instance, the fields in the 2012 study were relatively small, which begged the question of whether the community distribution trends they observed would also be seen in larger fields. Therefore, we designed one of my chapters to explore this very question, and we found that while carabid abundance increased with distance from the field edge, their genus richness (number of genera) did not change.</p>
<p>We also found, in a study that was its own chapter in my thesis but was combined with the diversity study into one manuscript, that the most abundant carabid species in blueberry fields, <em>Harpalus rufipes</em>, displaces itself about 14.5 m/day by walking. We discovered this by marking the beetles with fluorescent paint, releasing them at the centre of many concentric rings, and then coming back to look for them with UV flashlights at night! I must say, that was arguably the most fun part of my MSc!</p>
<p>Combining these two studies into one allowed us to look at the carabid community in blueberry fields from two points of view, those being species distribution and individual movement, which gave us a more complete idea of how carabids exist in that system. Our study was published by Oxford University Press in the journal <em>Environmental Entomology</em>. You can find it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaa047" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Lowbush blueberry fields tend to be managed in a two-year cycle, where in one year the field is in vegetative growth (locally called a sprout field) and in the other it is in fruit-bearing mode (called a crop field). At the end of the crop year, growers mow the field down to the ground to begin the cycle anew. In sprout fields, there tends to be a large number of weed seeds on the ground from the previous year, many of which can germinate. At the same time, there is an abundance of two very common carabid species, <em>Poecilus lucublandus</em> and <em>Pterostichus mutus</em>, both of which are generally known as carnivores, with some rare reports of them eating seeds. The natural question that followed these observations was: are there such high numbers of beetles in those areas because they are consuming the weed seeds? Our experiments showed that they are very likely not there to eat those seeds, and the reasons why they appear in such abundance in sprout fields are still a mystery. Our study was published by Oxford University Press in the <em>Journal of Insect Science</em> and you can find it <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jisesa/iez027" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>During a “directed studies” course, where we were expected to develop a research project on our own and present it at the end of term, I studied how light affected the movements of the carabid beetle <em>Harpalus rufipes</em>, the most common species in lowbush blueberry fields. I did not have access to infra-red cameras nor any fancy equipment, and therefore needed to come up with a way to measure the effects of different light treatments (including no light at all) with the resources I had at hand. After much trial and error, I settled on a table covered with a black tarp acting as the floor of the arena where the beetles would move, a Plexiglass circular wall to fence them in, sand for the surface on which they would walk, and equidistant lines of fluorescent powder. As the beetles would walk past these lines of powder, they would drag it around, leaving behind a fluorescent footprint of their movements in the sand. We then photographed these arenas under UV light and quantified these bettles’ movement patterns under the influence of different light treatments. This experiment was carried out in a very affordable manner, especially considering that we quantified movements in the dark without infra-red cameras! Our study was published by Cambridge University Press in <em>The Canadian Entomologist</em> and you can find it <a href="https://doi.org/10.4039/tce.2020.48" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>For my undergraduate thesis project, I studied the blueberry spanworm (<em>Itame argillacearia</em>) parasitoid populations in Nova Scotia lowbush blueberry fields. Spanworm outbreaks are a well-known source of stress and income loss to growers, but they occur in not-so-predictable patterns, and the reasons why the spanworm population numbers stay low (sometimes years at a time) are not very clear. In 2015, researchers at Dalhousie University published findings that the blueberry spanworm populations from two commercial blueberry fields had parasitism rates of around 50-60%, which could be the reason behind the spanworm population suppression! So to expand on these findings, we sampled 15 fields, 8 of which had enough blueberry spanworm larvae for us to collect and bring back to the lab. We found that around 22% of the spanworm larvae were parasitized either by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae or flies of the family Tachinidae, which is lower than what was reported in the 2015 study. This can be explained, however, due to the fact that we had larvae from many more different sites. These are still considerably high numbers, which means parasitoids may very well be behind at least some of the periodically low spanworm population numbers! Our study was published by the Acadian Entomological Society in the <em>Journal of the Acadian Entomological Society</em>, and you can find it <a href="https://acadianes.org/journal/papers/cutler_16-4.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
