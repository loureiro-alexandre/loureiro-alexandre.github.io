    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nI’m an ecologist who likes to study ecology at all scales and settings, from applied agriculture to “basic science” questions, and from individual physiology and behaviour, to global community distribution patterns. I’m completely mesmerized by nature, and being able to describe even a bit of it and then share this knowledge with others is an absolute thrill. On a technical level, I am very interested in statistics and reproducible research practices, so wherever I can, I use the programming language R and the scientific writing software Quarto, which integrates both markdown text (plain text) and R code into one document (for instance, I made this website in Quarto!).\nYou can find more about me in the “About” tab and more about my work (past, present, and future) in the “Research” tab.\nIf you are interested in chatting with me, feel free to send me an email!\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n  \n    \n     Scholar\n  \n  \n    \n     ORCID\n  \n  \n    \n     GitHub\n  \n  \n    \n     Twitter\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn"

    "text": "I was born and raised in Recife, Brazil. I, therefore, could never escape (and in fact I did not want to!) the full majesty of life in the tropics. It is everywhere you look, and everywhere you go. I, in particular, was completely obsessed with the leaf-cutter ants that created mighty civilizations in my front yard to my absolute delight, and my mothers absolute dismay, because it meant her much cared-for garden now had its days numbered. After a high school exchange trip to Nova Scotia, Canada, and a subsequent scholarship to Dalhousie University, I moved to Canada in 2012 to pursue a BSc in Agriculture with a major in environmental sciences.\nDuring my Time at Dalhousie University, I got involved in Dr. Chris Cutler’s entomology laboratory, where I started as a volunteer research assistant in my first year, and then was hired as a summer research assistant for every summer until I started my Masters. In my MSc, also under Dr. Cutler’s supervision, I was finally in charge of a large-scale project, and it was at that time that I fell in love with statistics. I went from having a self-declared dislike for it, to wanting to learn about it more and more, to literally “spreading the good news” to my friends. I quickly became the “stats guy” for my lab and I have maintained this reputation ever since. Aside from stats, I got to learn a lot about ecology, community ecology, and the Carabidae fauna found in lowbush blueberry fields, but as I said earlier, my “gateway drug” into biology were ants, so I went looking for some kind of ant project for my PhD.\nIt was thus that I came across Dr. Alex Smith on my Google searches for ant researchers in Canada. I promptly fired him an email explaining to him just how much I love ants and how I would love to work with him. After some email exchanges and video calls, I started my PhD at the University of Guelph under Dr. Smith’s supervision. I was Costa Rica bound, as all of my field work was going to happen there, but somehow, he convinced me to work with beetles again (rove beetles this time) instead of ants! Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, however, and all field trips cancelled for the foreseeable future, I needed to re-design some of my work, which meant now I was going to do field work at local woods in Guelph, and, wouldn’t you know it, meant that I was finally going to work with ants!\nIn my PhD work (which is ongoing) I’m learning more about how abiotic variables (temperature, humidity, and elevation) and corresponding physiological traits for ants and beetles (thermal tolerance and cuticular hydrocarbons) explain (or not!) their community distribution in space."

    "text": "MSc (Dalhousie Universtiy)\nFor my MSc thesis, I studied the ecology of ground beetles (Carabidae) in lowbush blueberry fields, from individual feeding behaviours and movement, to genus-level community analyses. Ground beetles are known for being beneficial insects in lowbush blueberry fields, where they feed on both weed seeds and on the larvae of some insect pests. In 2012, researchers found over 50 species of ground beetle that range from herbivores to carnivores within blueberry fields and described some of their community distribution within their fields of study. My chapters expand on some of that work and tackled different questions relating to some of the most abundant carabid species in lowbush blueberry fields!\n\nCarabid diversity across space and time, and the dispersal ability of Harpalus rufipes\nThat being said, there was still so much to explore! For instance, the fields in the 2012 study were relatively small, which begged the question of whethere the community distribution trends they observed would also be seen in larger fields. Therefore, we designed one of my chapters to explore this very question, and we found that carabid abundance increased with distance from the field edge, but that their genus richness (number of genera) did not change. Our study was published by Oxford University Press in the journal Environmental Entomology, and you can find it here.\n\n\nFeeding behaviours of two abundant early spring carabid species\nLowbush blueberry fields tend to be managed in a two-year cycle, where in one year the field is in vegetative growth (locally called a sprout field) and in the other it is in fruit-bearing mode (called a crop field). At the end of the crop year, growers mow the field down to the ground to begin the cycle anew. In sprout fields, there tends to be a large amount of weed seeds on the ground from the previous year, many of which can germinate. At the same time, there is an abundance of two very common carabid species, Poecilus lucublandus and Pterostichus mutus, both of which are generally known as carnivores, with some rare reports of them eating seeds. The natural question that followed these observations was: are the beetles there in such high numbers because they are consuming the weed seeds? Our experiments showed that they are very likely not there to eat those seeds, and the reasons why they appear in such abundance in sprout fields are still a mystery. Our study was published by Oxford University Press in the Journal of Insect Science and you can find it here.\n\n\nA method to measure terrestrial arthropod movement in the laboratory, in the dark\n\n\n\nMovement prints of beetles under our “day light” treatment.\n\n\nDuring a “directed studies” course, where we are expected to develop a research project on our own and present it at the end of term, I studied how light affected the movements of the carabid beetle Harpalus rufipes, the most common species in lowbush blueberry fields. I did not have access to infra-red cameras nor any fancy equipment, and I needed to come up with a way to measure the effects of different light treatments (including no light at all) with the things I had at hand. After much trial and error, I used a table with black tarp as the floor of the arena where the beetles would move, a plexiglass circular wall to fence them in, sand as the surface in which they would walk, and equidistant lines of fluorescent powder, which they would drag around as they walked pass these lines of powder, leaving behind a fluorescent footprint of their movements on the sand. We then photographed these arenas and quantified movement patterns of these beetles under the influence of different light treatments in a very affordable manner, especially considering that we quantified movements in the dark without infra-red cameras! Our study was published by Cambridge University Press in The Canadian Entomologist and you can find it here."

    "text": "BSc (Dalhousie University)\nFor my undergraduate thesis project, I studied the blueberry spanworm (Itame argillacearia) parasitoid populations in Nova Scotia lowbush blueberry fields. Spanworm outbreaks are a well-known source of stress and income loss to growers, but they happen in not-so-predictable patterns, and the reasons why the spanworm population numbers stay low (sometimes years at a time) are not very clear. In 2015, researchers at Dalhousie University found that the blueberry spanworm populations from two commercial blueberry fields in 2012 had parasitism rates of around 50-60%! So to expand on these findings, we sampled 15 fields, 8 of which had enough bluebery spanworm larvae for us to collect and bring back to the lab. We found that around 22% of the spanpworm larvae were parasitized either by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae or flies of the family Tachinidae, which is lower than what was reported in the 2015 study, but explainable due to the fact that we had larvae from many more different sites.
