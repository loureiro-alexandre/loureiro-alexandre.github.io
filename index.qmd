Welcome to my website! 

I'm an ecologist who likes to study ecology at all scales and settings, from applied agriculture to "basic science" questions, and from individual physiology and behaviour to global community distribution patterns. Generally speaking, I'm interested in learning about how species distribute themselves in space and what drives those distributions, which allows me to explore that theme within many different settings. On a technical level, I am very interested in statistics and reproducible research practices, so wherever I can, I use the programming language R, the version control software Git, GitHub, as well as the scientific writing software Quarto, which integrates both markdown text (plain text) and R code into a single document (for instance, I made this website in Quarto!).

I am currently employed as the Living Lab Coordinator for the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture, where I coordinate the co-development and implementation of best management practices in agricultural fields with producers, researchers, industry, and government in Nova Scotia. Please check out the <a href="https://nsfa-fane.ca/livinglabs/" target="_blank">Living Lab - Nova Scotia website</a> to learn more about the project.

If you want to contact me, feel free to reach out through the links on this page and on the navigation bar!
